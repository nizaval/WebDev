        <p class="para1">I am in my second year here at Pearl River Community College. I graduted class of 2020
                         from Sumrall high school. I have only one semester left before I graduate from PRCC. It has been a 
                         pretty good experience so far.
                        </p>

        <p class="para1">After graduation I plan to start working full-time. I plan to focus specifically on
                         front-end web development. After working for a little while I do plan to get my bachelors degree in <em>computer science.</em>
                         </p>

        <p class="para1">I plan to work part-time and do school part-time during this period of time. While the bachelors degree is not 
                         100% necessary. As a Latina woman in STEM. It is still going to help me progress in my career.</p>
