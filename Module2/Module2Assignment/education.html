        <p class="para1">A variety of institution types offer higher-education degrees. Liberal arts institutions, for example, offer courses in the arts, 
          humanities, languages, and social and physical sciences. The majority of liberal arts institutions are private. Private colleges and universities are funded by a combination
          of endowments, gifts from alumni, research grants, and tuition fees.Private colleges and universities are usually smaller than public institutions and can have a religious 
          affiliation or be single-sex schools.</p>

        <p class="para1">The U.S. academic calendar typically runs from September to May and can be divided into two academic terms of 16-18 weeks known as semesters. 
          Alternatively, some schools may operate on a quarter or trimester system of multiple terms of 10-12 weeks.</p>

        <p class="para1">Regardless of the institution type, in the United States, students typically earn credits for courses they take and these credits 
          count towards the completion of a program. Courses are often divided into "core" subject areas to provide the foundation of the degree program and "major" 
          courses to provide specialization in a subject area. Students can also take "elective" courses to explore other topics of interest for a well-rounded educational experience.</p>
