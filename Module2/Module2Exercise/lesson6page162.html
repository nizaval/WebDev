      <p class="para1">Breaking newa, also known as a special report or news bulletin, is a current issue that broadcasters feel warrants
        the interruption of schedules programming and/or current news in order to report its details.
        Its use is also assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a story that is being covered live.
        It could be a story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and phrase "Just In" is 
        sometimes used instead.
      </p>
      <p class="para1">In early coverage of a breaking story, details are commonly sketchy, usually due to the limited
        information available at the time. For example, during the Sago Mine disaster, initial reports were that all twelve
        miners were found alive, but news organizations later found only one actually survived.
      </p>
      <p class="para1">Another criticism has been the diluting of the importance of breaking news by the need of 24-hour news channels
        to fill time, applying the title to soft news stories of questionable importance use of the term is excessive,
        citing occasion when the term is used even though schedules programming is not interrupted.
