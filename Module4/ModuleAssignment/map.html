<h2>Animal Planet</h2>
<a id="animal">
  <p>Animal Planet was launched on June 1, 1996; it was created by Discovery Communications in cooperation<br>
   with BBC Worldwide. On January 1, 1997, Animal Planet's distribution grew as a result of Advance <br>Entertainment Corporation 
   selling the satellite transponder slot belonging to the WWOR EMI Service <br>(a national superstation feed of Secaucus, 
   New Jersey/New York City's WWOR-TV, that was implemented <br>following the 1989 passage of the Syndication Exclusivity Rights
  Rule by the Federal Communications Commission)<br> to Discovery Communications, replacing the feed with Animal Planet outright.[4]

<h2>Discovery Channel</h2>
<a id="discovery">
  <p>The Discovery Channel began broadcasting on June 17, 1985. It was initially available to 156,000 
    households <br>and broadcast for 12 hours each day between 3 p.m. and 3 am. About 75 percent of its program content <br>had never been 
    broadcast on U.S. television before.[9] In its early years, the channel's focus centered on<br> educational programming in the form 
    of cultural and wildlife documentaries, and science and historical specials.<br> It also broadcast some Soviet programming during 
    this time, including the news program Vremya.[10] The channel<br> also carried two teletext services over its VBI during this time, 
    Infotext (offering news from the Associated Press,<br> as well as information about agribusiness and agriculture, including commodity 
    prices from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on a 15-minute delay),<br> and Datavizion (offering trivia, strange news stories, games 
    and a satellite TV guide); both services originated from WHA-TV in <br>Madison, Wisconsin, and were run by the University of 
    Wisconsin-Madison.[11][12] In 1988, the channel premiered the nightly<br> program World Monitor (produced by The Christian Science 
    Monitor). In 1988, The Discovery Channel debuted an annual programming<br> stunt called Shark Week, the week-long event eventually 
    gained in popularity starting in the 1990s and continues to be shown each summer<br> on the channel to this day. By 1990, the channel 
    was available in over 50 million households.[citation needed]

<h2>History Channel</h2>
<a id="history">
  <p>In 2021, the History network ordered a documentary series covering the history of the decades long 
    Star Trek science fiction franchise.<br>[6] Brian Volk-Weiss is the planned director who had done documentaries for Netflix, as 
    well as a previous History Channel special <br>on Star Trek for its 50th anniversary in 2016.[6] They planned to go over the long 
    history of the franchise including its various television<br> series and conduct cast interviews.[6] On December 8, 2021, History 
    received a major rebrand for the first time since 2008. <br>The logo kept the golden letter ‘H’ used since launch in 1995.

<h2>National Geographic</h2>
<a  id="national">
  <p>The first issue of the National Geographic Magazine was published on September 22, 1888, nine months 
    after the Society was founded.<br> It was initially a scholarly journal sent to 165 charter members and currently it reaches the 
    hands of 40 million people each month.<br>[10] Starting with its January 1905 publication of several full-page pictures of Tibet in 
    1900–01, the magazine changed from being <br>a text-oriented publication closer to a scientific journal to featuring extensive 
    pictorial content, and became well known for this style.<br> The June 1985 cover portrait of the presumed to be 12-year-old Afghan 
    girl Sharbat Gula, shot by photographer Steve McCurry,<br> became one of the magazine's most recognizable images.
